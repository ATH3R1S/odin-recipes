        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>1 to 1.5 tablespoon organic soya sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 tablespoon crushed black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>3 to 4 stalks of spring onion</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 to 1.5 tablespoon schezwan sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1.5 tablespoons of oil in a wok or pan on the highest flame. Add 1 tablespoon chopped garlic(2 cloves). Fry for about <br>30 to 40 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add 3 to 4 tablespoons spring onion whites and fry for a minute.</li>
            <li>Throw in half cup each of carrots, capsicums and shredded cabbage. Stir fry on the highest heat for 2 minutes. We don't<br>want the veggies to 
            become mushy. They must be crunchy so don't overcook.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile beat 2 eggs in a bowl until frothy. Slide the veggies to a side in the pan.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and pour the eggs. Scramble and cook on medium heat. If your pan is too dry you may add more oil.</li>
            <li>When the eggs are just cooked(soft set), sprinkle 2 to 3 pinches of salt. Do not use lots at this stage as the sauce is salted.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat and pour 1 to 1.5 tablespoon soya sauce or tamari to the hot pan. You may also add any other hot sauce <br>
            if you prefer. You can also add a tablespoon of rice vinegar and 1 to 2 tablespoon of schezwan sauce.</li>
            <li>Add cooked and cooled rice, half teaspoon ground pepper, a bit more of salt, 3 to 4 tablespoons spring onion greens and <br>
            1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil if required.</li>
            <li>Increase the flame to highest and stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes. You may add more salt, sauce and black pepper to your taste.</li>
        </ol>
